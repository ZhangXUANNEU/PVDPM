# PVDPM
This repository contains the source code related to our paper Physics-guided Variational Method for Fractional Flow Reserve Based on Coronary Angiography, which implements the proposed PVDPM described in the paper. We are currently cleaning up and gradually uploading all components, including data preprocessing, model training, and more. Please note that some parts may still be under construction or missing documentation â€” thank you for your patience! If you're interested in this project, feel free to star, watch, or open an issue.
